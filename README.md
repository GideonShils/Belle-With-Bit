# Belle with Bit

## Example React components from [Belle](http://nikgraf.github.io/belle/). Built using [Bit](https://bitsrc.io/belle/react-components#components)

Components can be imported with Bit:
```
bit import belle.react-components/components/button
```

and then used in a project as follows:
```js
import Button from 'bit/components/button';

<Button>Submit</Button>
```

To view all of the component examples, see the project [source](https://github.com/GideonShils/Belle-With-Bit/blob/master/src/index.js).
